// TITLE:  ePWM Using Trip-Zone Submodule.
//
//! \addtogroup driver_example_list
//! <h1>ePWM Trip Zone</h1>
//!
//! This example configures ePWM1 and ePWM2 as follows
//!  - ePWM1 has TZ1 as one shot trip source
//!  - ePWM2 has TZ1 as cycle by cycle trip source
//!
//! Initially tie TZ1 high. During the test, monitor ePWM1 or ePWM2
//! outputs on a scope. Pull TZ1 low to see the effect.
//!
//!  \b External \b Connections \n
//!  - ePWM1A is on GPIO0
//!  - ePWM2A is on GPIO2
//!  - TZ1 is on GPIO12
//!
//! This example also makes use of the Input X-BAR. GPIO12 (the external
//! trigger) is routed to the input X-BAR, from which it is routed to TZ1.
//!
//! The TZ-Event is defined such that ePWM1A will undergo a One-Shot Trip
//! and ePWM2A will undergo a Cycle-By-Cycle Trip.
//!
